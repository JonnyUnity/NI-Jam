  _subject: Complaints about Bob
  _emailBody: "Hey, You,\r\nI hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to you
    because I'm concerned about the recent hire of Bob. I understand that he knows
    a lot about our product, but he has a history of not being able to work with
    others and has been an overall negative presence in the office. Apparently, he
    doesn\u2019t even take care of his cubicle. I don't want him to have any negative
    impact on our team and would like to know if there's anything we can do to help
    him succeed. I\u2019m asking around, have you had any issues with Bob?\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve\r"
