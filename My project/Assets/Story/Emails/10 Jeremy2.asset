  _emailBody: "Hey you,\nI'm sorry to say this, but I think I have some bad news.
    Your boss is running with the mafia and they've been using Metronome's office
    as a front. I was able to get a picture of him with the boss of one of the biggest
    crime syndicates in town.\nI know this is a lot for you to hear, but let's talk
    about it over lunch preferably by the waterfront. \nThis link will show you.
    You\u2019re the only one who can bring this down. You need evidence of their
    actions. Send it to me and I can take them down. \nLooking forward to hearing
    from you\n Jeremy"
