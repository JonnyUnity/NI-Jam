  _subject: Don't Forget To Take Your Metronome
  _emailBody: '"Hey You,

    It''s been a while since we last spoke and I hope
    you''re doing well. I wanted to reach out because I know you''re a big fan of
    our Metronome Tablets.

    I''m sure you have a busy schedule, so we wanted
    to remind you that it''s important to take your Metronome Tablets as prescribed
    by your in-office doctor.

    We''ve been working hard to ensure that our tablets
    are as easy to take as possible, with the most natural ingredients possible.
    In fact, our tablets are so easy to digest that some people don''t even notice
    they''ve taken them!

    It''s important to take your metronome tablets every
    day. If you forget to take them, you may experience some side effects like nausea,
    vomiting

    (bleeding from the eyes, inflammation of the gut, rectal discharges,
    explosive bladder, Garz, and a few others.

    If you have any questions just
    get in touch!
