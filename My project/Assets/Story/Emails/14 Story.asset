  _emailBody: "Hey You,\nI'm sorry to write this to you,  I need you to read this
    email. I know how busy you are, but it's important that you read this email.
    If you don't, things could get really bad for you. I heard from through private
    channels that they are aware that we have someone on the inside. I think they
    have sent someone to close the leak. \nI hope that's not the case, though. Stay
    safe, be cautious and please let me know you\u2019re alive.\nJeremy"
