  _emailBody: "Hey!\r\nYour f^&kin\u2019 mistakes have ruined my business Get your
    head straight this is unacceptable I've attached a screenshot of the f^&king
    mess you\u2019ve made of my order. What am I paying you for?\r\nThis is a copy
    of the email confirmation that you sent me it says that my order was successfully
    processed and shipped out on 05/07/20XX!!! Clearly it wasn't shipped currently
    because it\u2019s full of shit and there's no tracking information available
    for it, so I can\u2019t send this turd back!\r\nIt's not just the shipping error
    either! The product itself was defective and unusable when I received it!\r\nYouve
    f^&ked me!!!!!\r\nF^&k you!!!!!!! \r\nFix this or I\u2019ll sue!!!!!!\r\nSweet
    Charlie Chillis. \r"
